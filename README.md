# NextGen o1

NextGen o1 overcomes the limitations of the OpenAI o1 model by adding critical functionalities. It introduces seamless browsing support, file uploads, and system messages, transforming the model into a powerful assistant capable of handling real-world tasks. Whether accessing real-time data, interacting with documents, or automating workflows, NextGen o1 delivers an unrestricted AI experience. Designed using advanced technologies, it boosts efficiency and productivity while breaking the constraints of the standard model. With NextGen o1, you can truly unlock the potential of AI and streamline your operations like never before.

`FYI`: **gpt-o1** had following limitations [click me](https://lablab.ai/blog/how-to-access-o1-models#limitations-and-future-enhancements).

So, what?

We implemented advanced capabilities to the existing **gpt-o1** thinking model.
